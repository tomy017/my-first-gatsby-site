  Gatsby lets you define a <title> and other document metadata with the Gatsby Head API. 
  You have to export a component called Head from your page template to apply the metadata. 
  Adding such metadata helps search engines like Google to better understand your site. 
  For this tutorial youâ€™ll only be adding titles to pages but you can also later add other metadata.
